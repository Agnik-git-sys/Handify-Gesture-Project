Project Progress Roadmap

This project is being developed incrementally, with each stage building on the previous one.
The focus is on understanding concepts clearly before moving to advanced gesture control.

✅ Stage 1: OpenCV Basics (Completed)

Goal: Verify webcam access and real-time video feed.

✔️ Open webcam using OpenCV
✔️ Capture frames in a loop
✔️ Display live video
✔️ Safely exit using keyboard input


✅ Stage 2: MediaPipe Hand Detection (Completed)

Goal: Detect hands and visualize landmarks in real time.

✔️ Integrate MediaPipe Hands model
✔️ Convert frames from BGR to RGB
✔️ Detect a single hand
✔️ Draw 21 hand landmarks and connections
✔️ Live, smooth hand tracking

✅ Stage 3: Landmark Point Extraction & Distance Math (Completed)

Goal: Extract exact hand landmark values and understand geometric distance.

✔️ Access individual landmark points (x, y, z)
✔️ Identify important landmarks (wrist, finger tips)
✔️ Understand normalized coordinate system (0–1 range)
✔️ Convert normalized values to pixel coordinates
✔️ Apply 2D distance formula (coordinate geometry)
✔️ Measure distance between wrist and index finger
✔️ Display distance values live on screen

✅ Stage 4: Hand Movement Detection (Completed)

Goal: Detect hand movement direction using coordinate differences.

✔️ Track wrist position across consecutive frames
✔️ Store previous x and y coordinates
✔️ Calculate movement vectors (dx, dy)
✔️ Understand screen coordinate system (x → left/right, y → up/down)
✔️ Detect LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN movement
✔️ Apply thresholds to reduce noise
✔️ Display dx and dy values live on the webcam screen
